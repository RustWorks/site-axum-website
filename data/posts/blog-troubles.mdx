## Adding MDX rendering

So, I tried toying around with a few options before I settled on my current setup.

`next-mdx-remote` was my first option, but it didn't work too well. I decided to settle on `mdx-bundler` instead.

## Adding highlighting

`remark-prism` was cool, but I found prism to be a little difficult to work with.
It's theming support was lackluster, and I ultimately liked highlight better.
I also switched to rehype rather than remark, as I heard some better things about it, so I ended up using [`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

## Final setup

I ended up settling on a few things:

- [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)
- [`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight)

Of course, I used my normal stack for the rest, being Next.js & Tailwind.

## Tailwind troubles...

I have used tailwind before, but I changed a bit of stuff in project structure for this one.
This resulted in some problems with Tailwind.
First, I forgot to add `layouts/` which I moved, in my `tailwind.config.js` file, so I had to add it.

```js {7}
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  purge: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./layouts/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
// ...
```

Then, after a bit of debugging, realized I had to add my `styles/` folder as well!

```js {7-8}
// tailwind.config.js

module.exports = {
  purge: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./layouts/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./styles/**/*.css",
  ],
// ...
```

This fixed everything, and now you are reading a cool syntax-highlighted blog!
