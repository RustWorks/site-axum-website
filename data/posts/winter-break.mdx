Hi there! As the year wraps up, there is some cool stuff I'm working on through this break.

## Learning

- Svelte, hoping to figure out what the hype is all about
- More API stuff!
- Ruby on rails (To help [@WoodlandsComputerScience](https://github.com/WoodlandsComputerScience) with their Web Development course)
- (Neo)vim! I used vim keybindings to write this blog post :D

## Projects

- A teacher interface for the TWS App team
- (?) freelancing @ school

Finally, my birthday is coming up this christmas! ðŸŽ…ðŸ¥³
Stay safe this break, and I hope you have a merry christmas and a happy new year!
